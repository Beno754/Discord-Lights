# Discord Lights
Control Philips hue lighting with User login.
Somedays I would only want to use my PC when friends were online in Discord. So I made my lights come on and change colour depending on who was online.
So I knew who exactly was online without checking the Discord app, allowing me to go about my day off the computer if necessary.
